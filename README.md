**The Fortran 95 codes for fast implementation of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of the one-dimensional signals.**

If you use our codes or your research is related to our paper, please kindly cite the following paper, in which the fast CWT algorithms are reviewed and compared.

## Tutorial:

Our codes can be used to process 1D signals with periodic boundary conditions as well as zero boundary conditions. In our codes, four types of wavelet functions are available, namely the cubic B-spline wavelet (CBSW), the Gaussian-derived wavelet (GDW), the cosine-weighted Gaussian-derived wavelet (CW-GDW), and the Morlet wavelet (MW).
